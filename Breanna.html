<p>Birthday note 

<p>To my daughter, 

<p>You do know that I suck at this but if you’re reading this I know you’re in an awe. This is probably the longest note I have written in my entire life for anybody. You entered in my life on April 17th, 2023 and from that day till today your bonds has taken various twists and turns.</p> 
<p>From being my coworker to work bestie to my therapist to my best friend to my badminton partner to my gossip partner to my daughter I have lived every moment with you. I wasn’t the greatest person you’ve ever known in your life, I have made mistakes not just mistakes but terrible sin and there is no room for forgiveness but what sets you apart from me is that you forgave me Everytime and I didn’t deserve that. </p>
<p>You have done unspoken things for me, you pay my credit card bills, you press my legs every night , you massage my head every night before sleeping, you are there to pack my tiffin, you would run behind me if I had not had any breakfast, you act like my mother more than my daughter. Having said that, you brought the rainbow in my life, you introduced me to your dad , we fall in love with one another and we raised you. </p>
<p>But today, this note is more about committing my mistakes, I am sorry that I couldn’t be your mother , I am sorry that I never stood by you when you needed me the most, I am sorry I hurt you by hitting you, i am sorry that i emotionally abused you. I am sorry that I never became the person you wanted me to, I am sorry for parting away with your father. </p>
<p>Nina, my precious little girl, I know that your father and I were so selfish thinking about our selves and our relationship that we completely ignored that you were a part of us. I never knew that you had a panic attack the night arwin picked you up from my place and now that I know I cannot forgive myself. Nina, you have given me my best friend and my mother back in my life. You brought me closer to my dad, you made me fall in love with the idea of spirituality, being grateful, being thankful to the people around you. </p>
<p>You often say that people don’t consider me anything, today I tell you what you’re. There are two kinds of humans one is a taker and the other one is a giver and you’re an ultimate giver, you offer love, dedication, loyalty and so much more to the people in your life. I’ve been rude to you, I hit you, I abused you, I hurt you, I have said the meanest things but you took that bullet with a smile on your face. </p>
<p>Nina, on this day I just want you to know that, I love you and I am wishing you a lifetime of happiness and a very happy birthday sweetheart.</p>


<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Mum <3</p>
