        <h1>Birthday Wish for Nina</h1>
        <div class="wish">
<p>Hey Nina,</p>

<p>Happy 24th birthday! üéâ I can‚Äôt believe how much you‚Äôve grown since I first saw you as a little girl scared of making mistakes. Now, you‚Äôre this amazing, strong, and bold person who always lights up the room with your smile.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve known you for a year and a half, and it‚Äôs been incredible watching you evolve in so many ways. You have such a good heart, deeply rooted in your faith but still open to new ideas and modernity. You bring a unique magic to the office‚Äîlike, seriously, talking to you is always a highlight of my day. I feel like your work mom, and I‚Äôm so glad to be part of your journey.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre always so humble and shy away from compliments, but today, on your special day, I want you to know how proud I am of you. You‚Äôre truly a gift to all of us. I still remember that moment in the hospital with Shane‚Äîhugging you so tight and seeing him finally smile after a tough day. I love the bond you two share and your fun competitive spirit, especially when you jokingly say, ‚ÄúOh oh oh, I love money!‚Äù</p>

Y<p>ou deserve all the best things, and I‚Äôm always here for you. I miss you when you‚Äôre not around, and I hope you never leave us too soon. Happy birthday to my bundle of happiness!</p>

<p>With all my love,</p> 
<p>Savy</p>
