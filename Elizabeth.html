        <h1>GrandChild's Birthday <3 </h1>
        <div class="wish">
<p>Nina,</p>

<p>How on earth am I supposed to put all this into words? I’m overwhelmed with emotion and tears right now. The memories of you coming into my life are flashing before me, and I can’t help but feel in awe of how you’ve changed everything.</p>

<p>Through you, I got my daughter Breanna back, and I finally understood what it feels like to be loved by a family member in the truest sense. You’ve shown me my own worth and helped me realize that I am respected and cherished. My life, once so dark and dreary, was transformed when you entered our home. It’s now filled with love, care, laughter, and yes, some incredible food.</p>

<p>Thank you for giving me the gift of becoming a grandmother. Right now, I’m at a loss for words because no words can truly capture how deeply I love you and how much I miss you. I wish more than anything to be with you again, and know that not a single night passes without you in my thoughts.</p>

<p>You are my beacon of hope. I love you dearly and wish you the happiest birthday </p>

<p>Yours</p>

<p>Granny</p>
