            <p>Dear Nina,</p>
            <p>I often find myself at a loss for words when trying to express just how much you mean to me. From the very beginning of this journey, I didn’t know where it would start or end, or what paths we would cross along the way. But what I did know, and what has always been a constant, is that you have been by my side through it all — as my friend, my sister, my daughter. You have always had my back, never once leaving me to face life’s challenges alone</p>
            <p>I still remember those times when you would chide me for not calling you during my business trips, and the days when you would quietly eat alone, missing me more than words could say. I’ve seen you at your best and your worst, and through every moment, you have shown incredible strength and grace. You have grown into such a well-mannered, kind-hearted person, someone who holds no grudges and always wishes the best for everyone, even those who may not have appreciated you as they should have</p>
            <p>I pity those who have judged you by your past, as if they themselves have lived without fault. They’ve missed out on knowing a person who has always been genuine and selfless in her intentions</p>
            <p>As we move forward, I want you to know how proud I am of the person you’ve become. You cherish every bond you make, treasuring each connection with an open heart. It fills me with joy to see you growing every day, not just professionally but also spiritually. Your ability to connect people to their roots and to teach them about faith and family is truly remarkable</p>
            <p>As we move forward, I want to acknowledge the special bond we share — a bond that transcends what others may think or say. We understand each other on a deeper level, and we know how we connect in ways that are uniquely ours. I want to apologize for not reaching out when I wasn’t feeling my best. I know that if I had told you, you would have worried endlessly about me, maybe even making promises or sacrifices for my well-being. I never want to put your health at risk because of me</p>
            <p>I never intend to hide things from anyone, especially from those who care so deeply about me. I know how much you all worry when I’m out late, waiting anxiously for the moment I say, "I’m home." And as much as you might think I don’t notice, I see it all — the relief in your messages, the unspoken concern. I can sense what you’re feeling just from the way you type</p>
            <p>I’m truly sorry for any misunderstandings, and I promise to always be honest with all of you, without hesitation. This message isn’t just for you but for everyone who’s been there for me</p>
            <p>You are the best, and I hope you know how much I treasure our friendship, our brother-sister bond, and our father-daughter relationship. I will always be here to guide you, grounded in faith and love. I’ll always be here for you, Nina. For life. You are so precious to me and to everyone who knows you. Be the shining star of our home, always keep shining, and stay happy</p>
            <p>There’s more I want to say, so make sure to listen to the voice note in the next slide</p>
