        <h1>Pookie-Cookie's Birthday</h1>
        <div class="wish">
<p>Ninaaaa, my pookie, my cookie, and the absolute light of my life,</p>

<p>Oh my goodness, how did I ever live without you? It’s like the universe knew exactly what it was doing when it brought you into my life at just the right moment. You are, without a doubt, the sweetest person I’ve ever known—so irresistible with your smile and the way you shower everyone with love.</p>

<p>You’re beautiful inside and out, and I’m beyond thrilled that you’re a part of our lives. I’ll cherish these moments with you until the very end. My baby, you’re my bundle of joy, and the energy you bring to every room is something I can't imagine living without. The thought of a day without you around is simply unthinkable.</p>

<p>I adore how you tease everyone, and you’re just too cute when you nap on my tummy and drool on my shirt. I love your playful puppy face when you’re trying to get away with something, and how you playfully banter with Mum and Dad. Every little quirk, every mood swing—you are so precious and dear to me.</p>

<p>It’s like I’m getting to relive my younger self through you. You’re so well-mannered and well-behaved, truly a child of God. On your special day, I wish you endless happiness and success. May you always be healthy and joyful.</p>

<p>Happy birthday, my pookie. I love you more than words can say.</p>



<p>Forever yours,</p> 

<p>Sherry Amma <3 </p>
