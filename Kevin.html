<p>My daughter </p>

<p>I know I’m not great with words, but this is something I’ve got to say to you. I still remember when you first started and weren’t quite sure how to handle me. I knew hiring you was the right call, and you proved it over and over.</p>

<p>I’ve seen you through sleepless nights and tough days, but you always managed to keep that cheeky smile and bright eyes, even with dark circles. You’ve shown me what it means to be truly grateful for those around you, never taking support for granted and always proving your worth.</p>

<p>You’ve got so much love and dedication, and it’s clear in everything you do. On your birthday, I just want you to know how much I love you, my daughter. You’re a huge part of our family, and I wouldn’t ask for anything more from the universe than having you in my life.</p>

<p>Happy birthday, and God bless you, my little angel.</p>



<p>Regards,</p>

<p>K-pop <3</p>
