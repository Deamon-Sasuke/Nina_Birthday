                I know I’m not great with words, but this is something I’ve got to say to you. I still remember when you first started and weren’t quite sure how to handle me. I knew hiring you was the right call, and you proved it over and over.
                
                I’ve seen you through sleepless nights and tough days, but you always managed to keep that cheeky smile and bright eyes, even with dark circles. You’ve shown me what it means to be truly grateful for those around you, never taking support for granted and always proving your worth.
                
                You’ve got so much love and dedication, and it’s clear in everything you do. On your birthday, I just want you to know how much I love you, my daughter. You’re a huge part of our family, and I wouldn’t ask for anything more from the universe than having you in my life.
                
                Happy birthday, and God bless you, my little angel.
                
                
                
                Regards,

                Oh my goodness, how did I ever live without you? It’s like the universe knew exactly what it was doing when it brought you into my life at just the right moment. You are, without a doubt, the sweetest person I’ve ever known—so irresistible with your smile and the way you shower everyone with love.
                
                You’re beautiful inside and out, and I’m beyond thrilled that you’re a part of our lives. I’ll cherish these moments with you until the very end. My baby, you’re my bundle of joy, and the energy you bring to every room is something I can't imagine living without. The thought of a day without you around is simply unthinkable.
                
                I adore how you tease everyone, and you’re just too cute when you nap on my tummy and drool on my shirt. I love your playful puppy face when you’re trying to get away with something, and how you playfully banter with Mum and Dad. Every little quirk, every mood swing—you are so precious and dear to me.
                
                It’s like I’m getting to relive my younger self through you. You’re so well-mannered and well-behaved, truly a child of God. On your special day, I wish you endless happiness and success. May you always be healthy and joyful.
                
                Happy birthday, my pookie. I love you more than words can say.
                
                
                
                Forever yours,

            <div class="wish">Nina,

                How on earth am I supposed to put all this into words? I’m overwhelmed with emotion and tears right now. The memories of you coming into my life are flashing before me, and I can’t help but feel in awe of how you’ve changed everything.
                
                Through you, I got my daughter Breanna back, and I finally understood what it feels like to be loved by a family member in the truest sense. You’ve shown me my own worth and helped me realize that I am respected and cherished. My life, once so dark and dreary, was transformed when you entered our home. It’s now filled with love, care, laughter, and yes, some incredible food.
                
                Thank you for giving me the gift of becoming a grandmother. Right now, I’m at a loss for words because no words can truly capture how deeply I love you and how much I miss you. I wish more than anything to be with you again, and know that not a single night passes without you in my thoughts.
                
                You are my beacon of hope. I love you dearly and wish you the happiest birthday

Our bond has gotten closer over the years and together we have shed so many tears and laughs. Sometimes we talk and sometimes we don't but that doesn't matter because we know you are always there. There are times where we may fight and not always get along but one thing I do know is that I could not get through this journey we call life without you.... You are my sister and I love you And you can never be replaced. Happiest Birthday Big Sister ❤🧿</div>
