                I know I‚Äôm not great with words, but this is something I‚Äôve got to say to you. I still remember when you first started and weren‚Äôt quite sure how to handle me. I knew hiring you was the right call, and you proved it over and over.
                
                I‚Äôve seen you through sleepless nights and tough days, but you always managed to keep that cheeky smile and bright eyes, even with dark circles. You‚Äôve shown me what it means to be truly grateful for those around you, never taking support for granted and always proving your worth.
                
                You‚Äôve got so much love and dedication, and it‚Äôs clear in everything you do. On your birthday, I just want you to know how much I love you, my daughter. You‚Äôre a huge part of our family, and I wouldn‚Äôt ask for anything more from the universe than having you in my life.
                
                Happy birthday, and God bless you, my little angel.

                Oh my goodness, how did I ever live without you? It‚Äôs like the universe knew exactly what it was doing when it brought you into my life at just the right moment. You are, without a doubt, the sweetest person I‚Äôve ever known‚Äîso irresistible with your smile and the way you shower everyone with love.
                
                You‚Äôre beautiful inside and out, and I‚Äôm beyond thrilled that you‚Äôre a part of our lives. I‚Äôll cherish these moments with you until the very end. My baby, you‚Äôre my bundle of joy, and the energy you bring to every room is something I can't imagine living without. The thought of a day without you around is simply unthinkable.
                
                I adore how you tease everyone, and you‚Äôre just too cute when you nap on my tummy and drool on my shirt. I love your playful puppy face when you‚Äôre trying to get away with something, and how you playfully banter with Mum and Dad. Every little quirk, every mood swing‚Äîyou are so precious and dear to me.
                
                It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm getting to relive my younger self through you. You‚Äôre so well-mannered and well-behaved, truly a child of God. On your special day, I wish you endless happiness and success. May you always be healthy and joyful.
                
                Happy birthday, my pookie. I love you more than words can say.

                How on earth am I supposed to put all this into words? I‚Äôm overwhelmed with emotion and tears right now. The memories of you coming into my life are flashing before me, and I can‚Äôt help but feel in awe of how you‚Äôve changed everything.  
                Through you, I got my daughter Breanna back, and I finally understood what it feels like to be loved by a family member in the truest sense. You‚Äôve shown me my own worth and helped me realize that I am respected and cherished. My life, once so dark and dreary, was transformed when you entered our home. It‚Äôs now filled with love, care, laughter, and yes, some incredible food.   
                Thank you for giving me the gift of becoming a grandmother. Right now, I‚Äôm at a loss for words because no words can truly capture how deeply I love you and how much I miss you. I wish more than anything to be with you again, and know that not a single night passes without you in my thoughts.
                You are my beacon of hope. I love you dearly and wish you the happiest birthday

            <div class="wish">To my daughter, 

                You do know that I suck at this but if you‚Äôre reading this I know you‚Äôre in an awe. This is probably the longest note I have written in my entire life for anybody. You entered in my life on April 17th, 2023 and from that day till today your bonds has taken various twists and turns. From being my coworker to work bestie to my therapist to my best friend to my badminton partner to my gossip partner to my daughter I have lived every moment with you. I wasn‚Äôt the greatest person you‚Äôve ever known in your life, I have made mistakes not just mistakes but terrible sin and there is no room for forgiveness but what sets you apart from me is that you forgave me Everytime and I didn‚Äôt deserve that. You have done unspoken things for me, you pay my credit card bills, you press my legs every night , you massage my head every night before sleeping, you are there to pack my tiffin, you would run behind me if I had not had any breakfast, you act like my mother more than my daughter. Having said that, you brought the rainbow in my life, you introduced me to your dad , we fall in love with one another and we raised you. But today, this note is more about committing my mistakes, I am sorry that I couldn‚Äôt be your mother , I am sorry that I never stood by you when you needed me the most, I am sorry I hurt you by hitting you, i am sorry that i emotionally abused you. I am sorry that I never became the person you wanted me to, I am sorry for parting away with your father. Nina, my precious little girl, I know that your father and I were so selfish thinking about our selves and our relationship that we completely ignored that you were a part of us. I never knew that you had a panic attack the night arwin picked you up from my place and now that I know I cannot forgive myself. Nina, you have given me my best friend and my mother back in my life. You brought me closer to my dad, you made me fall in love with the idea of spirituality, being grateful, being thankful to the people around you. You often say that people don‚Äôt consider me anything, today I tell you what you‚Äôre. There are two kinds of humans one is a taker and the other one is a giver and you‚Äôre an ultimate giver, you offer love, dedication, loyalty and so much more to the people in your life. I‚Äôve been rude to you, I hit you, I abused you, I hurt you, I have said the meanest things but you took that bullet with a smile on your face. Nina, on this day I just want you to know that, I love you and I am wishing you a lifetime of happiness and a very happy birthday sweetheart.
                                
                Yours,
