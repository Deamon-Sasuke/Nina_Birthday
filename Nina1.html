  <p style="color: white;">Dear Didi,
Having you as my sister is the biggest blessing that I will never take for granted.Our bond has gotten closer over the years and together we have shed so many tears and laughs.Sometimes we talk and sometimes we don't but that doesn't matter because we know you are always there.There are times where we may fight and not always get along but one thing I do know is that I could not get through this journey we call life without you....
You are my sister and I love you 
And you can never be replaced
Happiest Birthday¬†Big¬†Sister¬†‚ù§üßø
