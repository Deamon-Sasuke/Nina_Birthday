<p>CHUCKS!!</p> 
<p>Another year older, damn you getting old, can't wait to see those grey hair. Thank you for being my unofficial bodyguard and saving my arse from the parade of useless guys l've come across. You've always taken care of me in ways I didn't even realize I needed. I know we don't have the typical sweet, lovey-dovey. But honestly, I wouldn't trade our sarcastic, slightly dysfunctional relationship for anything. Who else would roast you like a marshmallow over a bonfire. And oh, how can I forget you still owe me $70 for all those bets you've lost.</p> 
<p>I forgive you for that questionable Malai Kofta dinner that almost gave me food poisoning. I forgive you for not closing the dahi's lid, which ended up spreading like raita all over the place, and instead of cleaning it up, we just laughed like maniacs. And yes, I even forgive you for slapping my thigh when we were kids. 
<p>l indeed am the best cousin you could ever get. </p>
<p>Beyond all the jokes, you're one of the most caring and genuine people I know. You're not just my sister; you're the brother I ever wanted who's my rock, my protector. I love you and I'm so lucky to have you in my life. </p>
<p>Happy Birthday, DiDi (don't be surprised) </p>
<p>PS: my wish to be pampered by mama -e- papa (tbd) is still on my list!</p>
